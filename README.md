# Weather Search

This project was made so that the user could search the Weather from anywhere in the world. To make searching locations easier, an autocomplete address search was added. This was done using Geoapify's Address Autocomplete API.

To get the Weather, data was retrieved from Visual Crossing's Weather API using JSON. This was displayed on a web page built with Bootstrap.
